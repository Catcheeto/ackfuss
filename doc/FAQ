AckFUSS FAQ

I've written this document to help answer common questions about running a copy of
AckFUSS, and how to do some basic things. This guide will be updated as I think of
new information to share, or have people asking me the same things over and over :)

Q. I want to add a new .c file, how do I do this?

A. Drop your new .c file in the src folder and be sure you put #include "h/globals.h"
   at the top of it. That's all! If you start to reference functions elsewhere then
   you'll need to include other headers as needed (comm.h for send_to_char, for example).


Q. How do I add new commands?

A. Either create a new .c file as outlined above or open an existing one and scroll
   to the bottom. Define your command as DO_FUN(do_my_cool_cmd) and write it. Then
   add a DECLARE_DO_FUN(do_my_cool_cmd); to the bottom of the appropriate header file
   and place an entry for it in the cmd_table located in interp.c. If in doubt, just
   look at another command for reference.


Q. How do I associate multiple keywords with a single helpfile?

A. You can make multiple keywords point to a single helpfile by symlinking to it.
   For example, you want the "Warrior" file to also be accessible via the keyword
   "Fighter". You would run the following commands in your shell, from within the
   help dir: ln -s w/warrior.mrt f/fighter.mrt
   Now when someone uses "help fighter" they will be displayed the contents of the
   help/w/warrior.mrt file, just as if they had used "help warrior".
   

Q. Somebody logged in and got the first admin account before me, how do I regain control?

A. First kill the MUD. You can do this via your shell by using ps to find the PID
   then kill -9 <PID>. Then remove the ackfuss/data/mudinfo.dat file and the other
   person's pfile (player/<x>/<name>). Re-start the MUD and make a new character; you
   should now be recognized as the first player and be granted full privileges.
