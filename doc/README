Welcome to AckFUSS!

Now that you've successfully untarred the mud, you'll want to do a few
things to help you along.  In the /src dir, there are some adjustments you
will want to make:  The config.h file contains user customizable strings,
take a look.

Edit the port number in your startup script for the port you want to use
for your mud.

If you are familiar with the IMC config file, you may hand edit it, or you
can configure it once online.

Once you have edited config.h cd to your /src dir, and type make.  You should
get a clean make, with no errors _or_ warnings...if not, please let Kline know
of any problems. Once your make is complete, again from the /src dir, type:
./startup &

You will get a message, hit return.  Your mud should now be running!
Telnet to the address and port of your mud, and connect with the name
Creator and hit return when it asks for a password if you are running a
non-bsd system, or use Creatorbsd and the password creator if you are on a
bsd OS.  This is the admin pfile, and should only be used to create your own
admin character.  Once you have successfully logged in, create another (new)
character, log them in, then with the Creator char, type setc
<yournewcharname> war 85.  At this point, the Creator pfile is no longer
required, and should be deleted from the shell to avoid security problems.

Enjoy AckFUSS, please be sure to notify Kline with any errors/bugs, and
consider our web site: http://www.ackmud.net as a source of information.
