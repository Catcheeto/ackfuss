4.3.6 - 25 Jul 08:
 Added a delhelp for the new helpfile system.
 Helpedit works with the new helpfile system.
 Added a basic Deathmatch arena and updated transdm to work with it.
 Removed clutchinfo command, it should have been a helpfile from the start.
 Removed mpstat and bundled it into mstat.
 Added file_open() and file_close() to handle fpReserve. Call file_close() even if file_open() failes to re-open fpReserve!
 Updated all wait_states (const table, etc) to fit properly with 100 pulse/sec.
 Merged multi_hit into one_hit and removed multi_hit. Call one_hit recursively if you need to.
 You can now 'owhere rare' to show all rares not currently held by players.
 Bug fix in area saving (they now save properly again).
 Census command added for area/mud wide MOB stats.
 Warcry is now a skill, not a spell. Beserk renamed properly to berserk.
 All imm commands in wizhhelp have 100% complete helpfiles.
 All mortal classes have 100% complete shelps.
 Stake and decapitate removed from mortal classes for use in Super Hunter later.
 All helpfiles are now stored individually on disk, and no longer im areas or memory. Options in config.h
 Added a FIGHT_DATA list for chars fighting. More resource efficient than cycling the whole MUD.
 Removed advance command (not needed).
4.3.5 - 03 Jul 08:
 Moved all super related stuff into its own struct, SUPER_DATA, within pcdata. This makes it more generic and easier to implement across all supers: vamp, wolf, and hunter (soon to be).
 Added gossip back in; not sure why it left.
 Fixed some minor level problems in the channel table.
 Added a bv_log() (thanks Abel!) to change bitvectors to enums. All channels now support a 'history' argument that will display the last MAX_HISTORY on each channel.
 Stance speed mods were redone for the new combat system, and now affect things.
 Fixed remort skills being in the wrong classes, oops. Also removed Nth attacks and coded new skills to replace them.
 Added fread_float to properly handle floats instead of the backwards hack I was using with atof().
 Minor help updates. Slowly but surely.
 Fixed a bug in sysdata and speed where I was incorrectly loading values with fread_number, so they all truncated at the decimal :).
 Obj speed is now settable in the OLC. If an object has a speed set, it will use it. If not, it will generate randomly each time the obj is loaded.
 Updated AREA_VERSION for this, so things should be backwards (but not forwards) compatible. IE: old areas will load fine, but once updated to the new version are unusable on an old format game.
 Speed properly in to test now.
 Added some consistency to logging and file naming.
 The sysdata command got a COMPLETE overhaul, and it now exceptionally more useful and easier to expand / maintain. Helpfiles added for it, too. Read them!
 Quest mobs will no longer auto-assist other NPCs or be aggressive.
4.3.4 - 01 Jun 08:
 Damage spells now have a +/- 10% randomness. It's pretty boring seeing the exact same damage all the time!
 strcat and the old safe_strcat were replaced with a newer xcat, along the lines of xprintf.
 When using 'long <str>' on an obj or mob it will auto-newline. No more need to $edit to add it.
 Moved most things to xprintf by Darien. It will log (to file and in-game) what overflows a buffer and the exact location in the code. Some things couldn't move, yet, as they rely on sprintf returning an int.
 Fixed a rare permanent loop issue in IMC.
 Fixed autoquest to ignore imms.
 Added an autodig feature for builders to automatically dig out exits while walking if enabled.
 Added Runter's bitmask system. This is not in active use yet, but I will be moving things to it slowly.
 Imms now see the vnum of mobs and objs while in the builder.
 Updated every mob in the game to have an appropriate race.
 Fixed a minor log inconsistency and imms now see mob races in addition to player races.
 Added 3 new player/npc races and 1 npc race.
 'rlist' will now display a data sheet per race with 'rlist <abbr>'.
 The race table has a new bool of has_money for configuring races that drop cash when they die (stop giving rats gold!).
 Changed load_obj() to not randomize the level if an obj is level 1 (was messing up newbie school gear).
 Mobs now take 8 hours to fill up on gold rather than 2.
 Removed the old has_exp_fix checks as they no longer apply.
 The imcrefresh routine goes off at midnight (game time) to help keep the mud connected to IMC. Only works if autoconnect is turned on.
4.3.3 - 24 May 08:
 Minor helpfile updates.
 Removed some duplicate code in bust_a_prompt() and added some new options.
 GCC4 fix in PUT_FREE; things compile cleanly once again!
 Updated max vnums to ~1.6bil. It can probably go higher, but really, do people need more?
 Removed rolling for stats from char creation. You now assign your own stats up to racial maximums.
 Added a commented block to comm.c for IP binding if it's ever needed.
 Removed quest_points from ch_data, moved everything to utilize the unused one in pc_data.
 Added statraise to raise permenant stats based on a request from Jawzith at the forums.
 Consolidated helps and system areas.
 Added checks in load_objects(), load_mobiles(), and load_rooms() to log if a vnum is out of range for the area it is in when loaded.
 Removed the silly immskll struct, commands should be handled via trust, not imtlset (now gone).
 Updated default prompt and 'prompt all' to something more user friendly.
 Added char_exists() func for future use to see if a pfile is valid.
4.3.2 - 21 May 08:
 Fixed race_table to properly correlate preferred class order between values.
 Updated user CPU seconds logging to match the rest of the log.
 Default quest item ranges are now correct out of the box.
 Removed references of pcdata->index as it seemed to be a duplicate of pcdata->order to hold class orders. Updated the base Creator pfiles along with this.
 Fixed a minor color issue in IMC, and hooked it to ACK!MUD monitor system.
 Properly re-ordered remorts to better reflect base classes.
 Updated the IMC2 client to IMC2 Freedom CL-2.1a.
