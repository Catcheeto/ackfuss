0 multi multiclass~
Ack! Mud now supports players having more than one class.

Eg, a player may chose to be Mage/Conjuerer or Thief/Warrior.

WHO and SCORE now report the levels gained.  A ' - ' character means that

the specified class is not available, eg:

Mag:23 Cle: - Thi: - , etc.  This means that player can advance in Mage levels,

but not in Cleric or Thief.

Skills and spells become available when ANY class' level meets the minimum

level required to use it.  The max level of the player is not used.

When casting spells, like above, the maximum level of THE CLASS THAT HAS ACCESS

TO THAT SPELL is used.  This way a char who is Mag:2 and War:50 won't be able

to cast 50th level Mage spells.


Level gain is no longer automatic.  The GAIN command must now be used instead,

to advance in the specified class.  See 'HELP GAIN' for more details.

~
0 boards~
There are now a number of _main_ boards on the game:

INFO Board - 5 rooms west of Midgaard Temple, this is used to hold rules and

	     general information.  Only Immortals can write on this board.

IDEA Board - In Midgaard Temple, this is inteneded to be used by players to

	     leave ideas for the mud.


There is also a board for players to use, for personal messages, etc.  It is

located 4 rooms west, 2 rooms south of Midgaard Temple.

To use the boards, you must be in a room with one :)

Type: WRITE <header> to leave a message, with the specified header/title.

      WRITE to:<name> to leave a private message.

      READ <number> to read a message.

To find out what messages are on a board, simply look at it.

There are also several other boards in the game, for clan and race use, as

well as various other use.

~
0 bank~
The BANK command allows you to carry out financial transactions with the bank 

of your choice.  All banks in the game respect a player's balance, meaning

you can use any bank you find.  

Usage: BANK [ balance | deposit | withdraw ]

BANK                 with no argument displays usage information.

BANK BALANCE         reports your current bank balance.

BANK DEPOSIT  <gold> deposits a specified amount of gold into your account.

BANK WITHDRAW <gold> withdraws a specified amount of gold.

Needless to say, you must have the specified amount of gold in your account or

inventory before you can deposit or withdraw it.

The banking system has been introduced as a measure to work alongside the new

limit on the amount of gold that a player can carry.  Eg:  How many people can

explore and fight, whilst carrying thousands of gold coins?

Crusades are auto quests that random mobs, depending on the average level of

the players logged on at the time. You must find the mob that stole the item,

get the item, and return it to the mob that wants it back.

Some questions you can ask on the crusade channel:

1 zmud client~
For those of you that haven't already, we recommend downloading a mud client

from the Internet.  @@lShades @@dof @@eEvil@@N recommends zmud, which can be

found at http://www.rt66.com/ zugg/zmud.html . For those of you that already

have zmud--here is a tip from Zugg himself :) Zmud sets the default color

scheme to bright, which unfortunatly swapps our colours around.  Reset the

color scheme in zmud to dim, and they will appear as we want them.

~
0 dirt~
DIRT is a combat skill.  The player will attempt to kick dirt into the target's

eyes, causing (very) temporary blindness, which affects the target's combat

abilities.

~
0 chwere~
CWHERE tells you the location of any fellow clan members, where ever they are

in the game.  You must belong to a clan to use this command.

~
0 adapt~
ADAPT allows you to have a weapon adapted for your use, if it's level is higher

than yours.  Adapt can only be used when in the room with a NPC that offers

his/her services for adapting.  Typing ADAPT with no argument reports the cost

of having a weapon adapted.

Once the weapon has been adapted, it's damage will have been lowered in line

with the decrease in the weapon's level to your's.  Any affects on the weapon

(Eg affects HITROLL) will be heavily reduced, and probably cancelled.

If, once a weapon has been adapted, it's attributes indicate it will cause NO

damage, it will crumble into dust, and you will lose it.  

~
0 heal~
HEAL reports which spells you are able to buy, along with the cost.  This can

only be done if with a NPC which offers spells - usually healers.

HEAL followed by a single character 'buys' that spell.

Eg: HEAL H  buys a heal spell.

All spells are only cast on the buyer.  No one else.

~
0 gain~
GAIN increases one of your levels.  Level gain is no longer automatic, due

to the 'semi' multiclass system.  Typing GAIN with no argument will report

which levels you are able to gain in, and the cost to do so (in xp).

Typing GAIN with the 3-letter abreviation for a class will advance your level

in the given class, if you can level in it, and if you have enough xp.

Eg: GAIN thi    will advance your thief level, if you are able to level thief.

See also:MULTI WORTH TRAIN

~
0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <'str'|'int'|'wis'|'dex'|'con'>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your

character has slightly random attributes.  The maximum value for each

attribute depends on your race and class.

It costs four practice to train an attribute, except that it costs

only three practice to train your prime attribute.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more

practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.

In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train

WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.

Train now reports the cost in practice points to increase an attribute.

It is also possible to spend practices on hit points or mana points.

~
0 PRAY~
Syntax: pray     <message>

Pray sends a message to *ALL* immortals on the game, even if they are wizinvis.

Eg: PRAY i'm stuck in a no-exit, no recall room - help!

WARNING: Un-necessary use of this channel will result in your ability to use

	 it being removed!

Syntax: flame    <message>      Syntax: race     <message>

Syntax: clan     <message>      syntax: music    <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive

shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

MUSIC, AUCTION, GOSSIP, NEWBIE, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages 

to all interested players.  '.' is a synonym for GOSSIP.  The QUESTION and 

ANSWER commands both use the same 'question' channel

FLAME is similar to auction, gossip, etc, but is intended for moaning about

life, players, etc.  ZZZ may only be used when sleeping.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

RACE sends a message to members of your own race.  CLAN sends a message to

those in your clan.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.

0 bad breath~
Bad breath is an offensive spell, causing slightly more damage than the


'magic missile' spell.

~
0 influx~
When successfully cast, this will heal all players in the room.

~
0 warcry~
WARCRY is a Warrior-only spell, which acts the same as the 'bless' spell.

~
0 pemote~
PEMOTE acts in the same way as emote, except that where emote adds your name

before the argument, PEMOTE adds you name PLUS the characters 's

Eg PEMOTE feeling rather annoyed with Immortals         would be shown as:

Stephen's feeling rather annoyed with Immortals.

~
0 alias~
The ALIAS command allows you configure the six alias 'slots'.  An alias

takes the form of a name, and the alias.  To set up a new alias, type:

ALIAS <slot_number> <name> <alias>		For example:

ALIAS 2 ban emote turns into a banana and splits...

Now, whenever you type 'ban' the mud checks through the command table.  If

your input wasn't found, it then checks your alias.  Upon matching 'ban'

it issues the alias to the interpreter function, along with any argument

you typed after the alias name.  For example, you can define an alias:

ALIAS 1 ff cast 'faerie fire'   and then use it on mobs by typing:

ff <target_name>.  So typing 'ff stephen' will cause the mud to interpret

cast faerie fire stephen.

To show what aliases are set, type ALIAS with no arguements.

To clear an alias, type 'ALIAS <number> clear'.

~
0 colour color~
Firstly, please note the spelling: coloUr.  This is an English mud, so we

use English spellings :)

The mud now supports "ansi" colour.  Use the config command to turn on

or off this option.  The COLOUR command allows you to set uo what colours

you see different things in.  Please note:  The list of things you can

configure WILL be expanding!

To find out what colours are available, type 'COLOUR HELP'.

~
0 worth~
WORTH simply displays a list of any classes you are able to level in,

along with the cost in exp to gain in it, and the difference between that

cost and your current exp.

~
0 tongue~
TONGUE is equivalent to SAY, except that only players of your race will

understand what you say.  Anyone else will see gibberish!  Note that the

RACE command will tell to ALL members of your race (who are on the channel)

even if they aren't in the same room as you.

~
82 halls~
HALLS is a command which will transfer you, the immortal to the Entry Point,

situated within the Halls of the Immortals.  It is similar to recall, except

that there are no limitations on use if fighting, etc.  

~
0 guild~
GUILD is similar to RECALL in use, except that it transfers you (if possible)

to your Guild room, in the Player's Rooms, west of the Temple.  They provide

an easy way to gain entrance to a Guild Room.  If fighting, the same penalties

stand as for recall.

0 law wanted lawless~
@@lShades @@dof @@eEvil@@N system of laws and punishments:

  Within the game, the major cities of the realm have a system of enforcing

rules of player behavior, by having certain players known to the realm as

being WANTED.  The system is simple, once you understand it's perspective.


  The civilized states of the realm enforce peaceful interaction between

citizens of the various states.  Killing and stealing from other citizens is

considered unlawful, and anyone that falls under the protection of the Law is

protected by these actions.


  There are three states that a citizen can have: Civilized, Wanted, and

Lawless.  Citizens that are Civilized are protected within the legal system

from being attacked by other citizens, and also from having things stolen from

them. If a Civilized citizen is attacked or stolen from, the Law will label

the attacker with Wanted, and deal with them accordingly.  In addition, if a

Civilized citizen breaks the Laws of the Realm, they also will be Wanted.


  Wanted citizens are no longer protected under the Law, and Civilized

citizens are authorized to kill or steal from them.  In addition, non-player

characters will interact with them violently.


  If you wish to become Lawless, this will your protection under the Law.

However, both actors in an interaction must be Lawless for the Law to ignore

their actions between each other.  If a Lawless attacks someone Civilized, the

Law will seek retribution on the Lawless.  If a Civilized citizen attacks a

Lawless, the Law doesn't protect the Lawless, it punishes the Civilized by

making them Wanted.  To become a Lawless, you may request a PKOK flag from an

Immortal.  Once you have chosen to be Lawless, the Law will never again place

you under its protection.


  Many hidden and unknown events in the game may take the protection of the

Law away from you, either permanently, or temporarily.  Some of these are

obvious, some not so obvious. A few of these events may even make you Persecuted,

which has several unforseen circumstances.


  When you become WANTED, either from breaking a law or other actions, you are

given a sentence based on your crime.  Sentences may only be reduced by

sacrificing valuable objects to the Law, by using the command sacrifice

<object> judge.  The judge will examine your sacrifice, and reduce your

sentence appropriately.


  The Law is omnicient in some ways, and becoming Wanted or Lawless may have

some unforseen repercussions, so consider your actions well before commiting

to them!


~
0 imm immortal immortals~
Due to some past events where common sense was overlooked

it was brought to the attentions of the immortals that there is a

problem in mortal/immortal relations.

The way the immortal team is run here is very leniant and laid back, much

less strict then those upon other Multi-User Domains. The point that

is trying to be made is simply to respect those who do rule upon the realms.

This has not been a wide spread problem but one that needed to be

addressed. Those immortals who you are aware that multi-play with mort

characters as well, remember that they are seperate entities in the realms.

All characters deserve respect....wether they be friend or foe.

Remember that anyone being rude or distasteful to not only immortals

but ALSO other morts will be dealt with accordingly.

~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  The amount of exp

you need to gain a level is determined by your race.  To gain a level, use

the GAIN command.

You gain experience by:

    Being part of a group that kills a monster,

    or by killing monsters on your own.

You lose experience by:

    Fleeing from combat

    Recalling out of combat

    Being the target of certain spells

    Dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players

are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment

versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed

lately; and some random variation.

@@dVampires, creatures of legend?  Perhaps....perhaps not.

Centuries ago, there were four creatures that decended upon the world.

These creatures were called Methuselahs.  Their evil was spread to

others of the world, by shear force of will, leaving those newly 

initiated "Nosferatu" without a clue as to their new nature...what they

were, how they became that way, why they lust...

For generations, the will of the Methuselah was obeyed to the letter,

until they disappeared from the world, taking the children that they

initiated, and those children's children, with them.  Nothing was

left for the Nosferatu to study from, no information, no divine "truth".

Centuries later, it is believed that the Methuselah have returned,

spreading their evil anew.  Reports have been told worldwide of a Chapel

where their evil is felt...the wind in the spires of the Chapel whispers

the word "m e t h u s e l a h".

Legend has it that the spirits of the original Methuselah haunt

the halls of this Chapel, waiting to take control of mortal (immortal?)

bodies, and walk the world once again....@@g

82 IMMRULES~
*******************************************************************

**** THESE ARE A BASIC, RUSHED-OFF SET OF RULES FOR IMMORTALS  ****

**** YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND AND ABIDE BY THEM!!!!  ****

*******************************************************************


Below follows a simple list of what you should and SHOULDN'T be doing,

whilst you are playing as an Immortal on SoE. Some muds have suffered

negative publicity via newsgroups. this is NOT something we wish to see

happening here :)

DON'T:

------

a) KILL PLAYERS - there are many ways, ALL of which are logged.  

b) HARRASS PLAYERS - by:

			  i) Changing their title with MSET 

			 ii) Changing sex/class/etc 

			iii) ATTACKING with SWITCH or FORCE 

			 iv) Changing mobs that are fighting players.

			  v) Misuse of channels.. emote/say/gossip/ etc

c) Misuse OLOAD and MLOAD to give players an unfair advantage in terms

   of equipment, or exp (from killing mobiles).

d) Misuse MSET and OSET to change the values on an item (to enhance eq)

   or to make high level mobs easy kills (to enhance exp).  Changing the stats

   on a Player shouldn't be done, either.

Basically, try to avoid doing stuff that players might not like at all.

Of course, misunderstandings will arise, but matters will be helped if

you haven't done anything to them, are polite, and don't simply fly off

the handle and freeze them.  FREEZE should only be used in really extreme

circumstances, not just as a way of expressing your anger.

(BTW, nearly all commands that could be used in ways 

 that would be considered violating these rules ARE logged.)

DO:

---

a) Be HELPFUL to players whenever possible.  If you're just sitting around

   talking to a friend, then you're not too busy to help a player.

   (Building *is* considered a good reason not to be helpful, but it would

    be nice if you could inform the player, instead of ignoring them.)

b) Be NEUTRAL - i.e. try not to play an evil or ultra-good char.  Players,

   especially newbies, will be more likely to stay if immortals are FAIR.

   For example, roleplaying Satan when an immortal would not be a Good Thing.

There are probably many, many more things that should be kept in mind. 


Remember that holding Immortal status on SoE is *NOT* your given right.

This may sound very heavy-handed, but remember these rules are meant more as

suggestions rather than rules.  If multiple complaints are made against

an immortal, the rules WILL be used, however.


Ultimately, the purpose of having a set of rules is to ensure ALL players

here get treated fairly, and equally.  Immortal giving hand-outs to their

buddies, and acting like idiots does nothing but damage the Mud and lose

unhappy players.


ALSO:

-----


Sadly, it seems that extra "rules" are required.  As above, these are 

really guidelines, but could possibly be used against you more forcefully

if there is cause for complaint.

i) [Added to "Don't: Harrass Players] Harrassing players includes being

downright unhelpful, or patronising.  If someone complains about something,

try to *HELP* them.  Don't simply say "Well, you're wrong".  Be _nice_ !

ii) On a similar theme, if someone complains about an area (especially one

you have built) then try to understand their position.  Yeah, it's easy to

tell them to "just go somewhere else and kill stuff" as an Immortal.  Think

how YOU would like it if that's how you were treated when playing your

mortal character.

iii) "Misuse of channels" INCLUDES the echo command.  Don't get nasty with

players over echo.  Just poke fun instead. :)  Again, put yourself in THEIR

place, and take a moment to think how you would like it.

This is a help file on clans; what they are, what they do, and how they do

it :)


First, Clans are groups of characters who help each other out on Shades of

Evil.  Undoubtedly, there will be some clan rivalry, but, hopefully, this

will not become too extreme :)  For you, the player, to join a clan, you

need to get ahold of the clan leader of the clan you want to join...he

or she can accept you into the clan -- if they decide you belong in the 

fold.

This is a help page for Clan Leaders devloping new equipment for their clan.

If you are not involved with this process, then there's not much here to

interest you.


If you are developing Clan Equipment, please note that you _must_ follow

these guidelines, if you wish your equipment to be considered legal.  You

will NOT be allowed to load any illegal equipment using the 'MAKE' command.


Each Clan may have 4 Pieces of equipment.  Each must be of different wear

locations.  You may not make staffs, wands, pills, scrolls, etc.  The only

equipment you can make are weapons, containers, or armor.


You have 'points' that you may distribute among the objects you make.

For 2 of the objects, you will have 20 points.  For the other 2, you will 10


Points are used to 'buy' stats on the object as follows:

So, to 'buy' An -20 AC affect would cost 12 points.  It doesn't mean you

get ALL the entries for a given price!


Limitation:   You can only have a maximum of 3 different affects on each

              object.



If you think your objects are legal, contact Stephen, who will check them.

If he agrees they are valid, they will be added to your clan equipment, and

leaders of your clan will be able to load them for their members.

Apostles are traditionally the intermediaries between mortals and the elder

Gods.



Here in the Realm you may contact an Apostle with questions you cannot get

answered from other mortals or for reimbursements, remorting, passing along

of messages, etc.  Simply send a tell to an Apostle and then be patient in

case they are busy.



Do not use the pray channel.  Again, this is for emergencies only when you

need a God and cannot see any visible ones.  If Gods are invisible it usually

means they are coding for the mud so please contact Apostles first.

BUILD HELP : SHOPS

------------------


Shops are basically mobiles with a few extras.  To make a shop, simply create

a mobile, and set the 'shopspec' part of the mobile.


trade0 - trade4 are the item types that the monile will buy or sell.

If you don't want 5 different item types bought/sold, leave some entries blank.


profbuy is the profit the shopkeeper makes when you buy an item.  100 = 100% =

no profit.  150 = 150% = a fifty percent increae in price.


profsell is the loss you make when selling.  100 = 100% = no loss.  50 = 50% =

you only get half the item's price from the shopkeeper.


profbuy should be no smaller than 100

profsell should be no larger than 100


openhour is the time the shop is 'open'

closehour is the time the shop is 'shut'


For a 24-hr shop, set openhour to 0 and closehour to 23.

still working this one out myself.  As far as i know, this method seems to

work:


set the door as type door, and as closed, locked or pickproof, as needed.

Add a reset to close/lock the door.

BUILD HELP : USING THE EDITOR

-----------------------------


Using the editor, it is possible to edit any strings you need.  The most 

common of these will be room descriptions.


To enter the editor, enter '$edit' as the string.  So, in Redit mode:

'desc $edit'  will allow you to edit the room's description.


To format the string, type '.f'

To see what other options are available, type '.h'

To finish editing a string, type '.'

BUILD HELP : STRINGS

--------------------


STRINGS are collections of characters: i.e. words or sentences.

The most visible parts of an area are the descriptions on mobiles, objects, 

and especially rooms.  Please try and bear some thought to how these will

look, especially for mobiles and objects that may end up out of their intended

positions.  Room descriptions should be neutral, and not too short, where

possible.

~
-1 build_flags~
BULD HELP : FLAGS

-----------------


Flags are used to represent many different values.  Becasue of the way they are

implemented, this means a saving in space.  One integer can store MANY different

flags.  For the use of ther builder, a flag is a certain type of attribute, 

that can be either on or off; true or flase; yes or no.

For example, rooms use flags to store such information as 'dark', 'no_recall',

'indoors' etc.  When a new object, room or mobile is created, some flags will

be set my default.  In order to set it to be whatver you wish, you will need

to set the flags properly.

~
-1 build_building~
BUILD HELP : BUILDING

---------------------


BUILDING is a term used to refer to adding Rooms, Mobiles or Objects to the

mud, whilst still playing it, allowing possibly instant inclusion of the

rooms/mobs/objects into gameplay.


The builder allows to you to add new mobiles, rooms or objects.  It is up to

you how they look and act.  You have complete control over how your area looks.

Bear in mind that if you make objects that are too powerful, you may be asked

to tone them down in power.  If this does not happen, then an Immortal will

have to do it.... 


You should decide a level range for your area, and build your mobs ABOVE that

range.  It is usually wise to check with a Creator about the theme of your

area, AND the level range.

~
-1 build_resets~
BUILD HELP : RESETS

-------------------


Each area typically consists of Rooms, Objects and Mobiles.  Rooms 'appear'

almost automatically, but for your objects and mobiles to be loaded requires

the use of RESETS.  Using the builder, you can add resets to rooms, to do such

operations as loading mobiles, equiping mobiles with objects, randomising

exits, etc.

~
-1 build_vnums~
BUILD HELP : VNUMS

------------------


"VNUMS" stands for "Virtual Numbers".  They are arbitary numbers used to identify either Rooms, Objects or Mobiles on the mud.  Each object, room and

mobile must have a unique vnum, for their type.  That is, you can't have two

mobiles with the same vnum, but you could have a mobile and an object using the

same vnum.  Think of each of the three "users" of vnums as being completely

sperate:  Mobile vnums have to be unique, but only for mobs.  Object vnums must

also be unique, but also only for objects.  Room vnums must be unique, but only

for rooms.  


Each area consists of: rooms, mobiles and objects, principally.  Each area has

a vnum range associated with it.  So, for example, the range is vnums 100 to 199

(Kiess area).  There are rooms with vnums 101 - 195, objects with vnums 

101 - 143, and mobiles with vnums 101 - 135.  It is normal to use consecutive

vnums starting at the lowest vnum, for all objects, rooms and mobiles in an area.  Please try to conform to this usage of vnums!

room, mobile or object.  If you want to see a list of flags (in wide format,

rather than the long format used when you screw up) type LIST HELP.


The lists of flags you can display vary according to which editing mode you are

in.  This is basically because there is a list of FLAGS for each mode, etc...


X may be used in place of LIST.
