IMCINVIS

Syntax: imcinvis               - makes you invisible to the network.

When you toggle the imcinvis setting, other users will no longer be able to see
you on the network in who listing, nor will they be able to send you tells.
You will also be unable to send your own tells.

The only thing invisibility does not stop is your ability to use network channels.
