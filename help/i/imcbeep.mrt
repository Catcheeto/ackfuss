IMCBEEP

Syntax: imcbeep person@mud     - "beep" a player over IMC

Sends a short sound tone to the person on the target mud. If their terminal
program supports it, it will make an audible beep to get their
attention. If you don't get a response, don't keep beeping. The person may
be busy or away and spamming them will only tick them off as well as
possibly leading to your IMC priviliges being revoked.
