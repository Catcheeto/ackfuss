IMCCHANLIST

Syntax: imcchanlist               - list all known IMC channels
        imcchanlist (channel)     - list details on one IMC channel

IMCCHANLIST displays information on channels active on IMC.
Without arguments, it will produce a display similar to:

Name            Local name      Owner           Perm    Policy
Server02:test   test            Samson@Alsherok Admin   Private
Server02:icode  icode           Samson@Alsherok Imm     Open
Server02:i2chat i2              Samson@Alsherok Imm     Open
Server01:ichat  ichat           Paradigm@Pabulu Imm     Open
Server01:pchat  pchat           Paradigm@Pabulu Mort    Open
Server02:irc    irc             Samson@Alsherok Imm     Open
Server02:i3chat i3b             Samson@Alsherok Imm     Open
Server10:UCMMCh UCMMChat        Ntanel@RM       Imm     Private
Server02:igame  game            Samson@Alsherok Mort    Open

This shows the channel's network name (eg. Server01:ichat), the local name
 eg ichat - which can be used as an abbreviation in IMCSETUP, and which is also
the command to speak on that channel), the owner of the channel
(eg. Paradigm@Pabulum), and the channel's policy.

Channel policies available are: open, and private.

Open channels can be seen and used by anyone meeting the mud's minimum level for IMC2.
Private channels can only be seen and used by the list of invited users.

If a channel is not configured locally, it will have (not local) for its local name.

If a channel is configured locally, but is not actually active on IMC2, it
will have an Unknown flag on it.

IMCCHANLIST with a channel name will provide detailed information on that
channel. For example:

Channel Server01:ichat:
  Local name: ichat
  Regformat : [ichat] %s: %s
  Emformat  : [ichat] %s %s
  Socformat : [ichat] %s
  Perms     : Imm

  Policy    : Open -- Open to all muds
  Owner     : Paradigm@Pabulum
  Operators : remcon@pabulum paradigm@pabulum
  Invited   :
  Excluded  :

This displays the channel name, local name, policy and owner, as above. It
also displays:

- The minimum permissions needed on your mud to see the channel.

- The format for displaying messages from the channel. These can contain
  any color codes etc that your mud uses.

  Regformat is the string displayed when someone speaks normally on the
  channel - the first %s is replaced by their name, the second %s by what
  they say.

  Emformat is a similar string for emotes. Again the first %s is their
  name, the second %s the text of their emote.

  Socformat is a similar string for emotes. Except there is only one %s and
  is the format used to send socials to the network.

- Any operators for the channel. This can only be changed by the owner of
  the channel. Operators can modify the 'invited' and 'excluded' fields
  via the IMCSETUP command.

- The invited and excluded people on the channel.
