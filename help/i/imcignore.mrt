IMCIGNORE

Syntax: imcignore                  - list current ignores
        imcignore add <target>     - add entry to ignore list
        imcignore delete <target>  - remove entry from ignore list

The IMCIGNORE command blocks all messages specifically directed toward an
individual user and is your first line of defense against an annoying pest.
You can specify individual users, or an entire mud using wildcards like so:

imcignore pest@mud
imcignore *@mud
imcignore pest@*

Before going to the mud's administration with a complaint, try this first.
If the particular person you are attempting to ignore continues to cause
problems or is becoming a nuisance to the mud in general, advise your mud
administration to seek the use of an IMCBAN command against them.
Be prepared to justify this with a good reason and provide any documentation
of any incidents your administrators ask for.
