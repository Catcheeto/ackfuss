IMCTELL

Syntax: imctell (person@mud) (message) - send a 'tell' to another player
Syntax: imcreply (message)             - send a 'tell' to the last player
                                         to send you a IMCTELL

imctell Name:MUD@I3 (message)          - Sends a tell to a person on the I3 network.

IMCREPLY will work on either a normal IMCTELL or one forwarded by the bridge.

A private message can be sent from you to a person on another mud.

To send a reply to someone who sent you a tell, simply use the
IMCREPLY command with your message.

Due to certain conditions within the network, your conversations COULD be
monitored, so don't send anything critical, like passwords or credit card
numbers ( or anything else you don't want to risk being snooped ), over an IMCTELL.
