IMCLISTEN

Syntax: imclisten               - display current channel status
        imclisten (localname)   - toggle a channel

IMCLISTEN lets you show and toggle which channels you are listening
to. Without arguments, it will show you the channels you belong to; with
an argument, it will turn that channel on or off.

Any channels you listen to must be locally configured first - see
IMCSETUP. IMCCHANLIST can be used to see available channels.
