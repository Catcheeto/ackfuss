BUILD HELP : MAKEAREA
------------------

The MAKEAREA command lets you create a new zone to build in.
Syntax:  makearea filename numrooms [system]

Filename need not contain '.are', it will be prepended automatically. Numrooms
is the total size of the zone. If 'system' is specified as a final argument, the
zone will be created within the system reserved (typically 1-1000) range of vnums
for system use. Otherwise, it will be created in the first available block of free
space > 1000.
