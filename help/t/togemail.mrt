TOGEMAIL

TOGEMAIL will display your current email preferences and let you change them.
You can choose to allow or deny players or immortals to send emails from the MUD
to your validated email address.

NOTE: This will only affect emails sent 1 on 1. Password recoveries and any system
notification emails will still be sent to you.
