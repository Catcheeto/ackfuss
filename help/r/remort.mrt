REMORT

Shades of Evil's remort policy is as follows:
        When you have attained 70th level in @@ytwo@@W classes, you may add
        @@yone@@W of the five remort classes to your character.
        When you have attained 70th level in that new class, and have
        attained 80th level in @@yall@@W five basic classes, you may add
        a @@ysecond@@W remort class.

        When you have attained 80th level in all classes, including the
        two remort classes, you will become an @@gAdept@@W.

When you are ready to remort, type gain <first three letters of new class>.

Remort classes are:
        -@@cKnight@@W
        -@@pSorcerer@@W
        -@@GNecromancer@@W
        -@@gMonk@@W
        -@@dAssassin@@W
