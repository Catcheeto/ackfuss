MQUEST QUESTMASTER

The questmaster system is now active. There are four commands available.
mquest request - gets a quest if a questmaster mob is in the room.
mquest giveup  - abandons a quest. This has a slight penalty.
mquest info    - display the relevant information about the quest.
mquest complete- hands in the quest if a questmaster mob is in the room.
mquest handin  - hands in currently held quest items to a questmaster.
mquest hint #  - Gives a hint for task ## in your quest list.
                 Your rewards will be reduced completely if you require
                 hints for each task.
Currently, there are four types of quests.
A (+) indicates a bonus reward. If the amount to retrieve is larger than 1,
there is typically a small bonus associated as well.
item retrieval   - Retrieve a certain # of a certain item.
multi-item retrieval   - Retrieve a certain # of numerous items (+)
creature killing  - Hunt down and destroy a certain # of a mob
multi-creature killing - Hunt down and destroy a certian # of numerous mobs (+)
There are plans to expand this system to allow for more complex, group
or mudwide quests in the future.
