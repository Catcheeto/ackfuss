AckFUSS

AckFUSS is a more modern MUD server derived from ACK!MUD 4.3.1. AckFUSS is primarily
written in C, with C++ being added as needed or replacing old code as time permits.

There is a special file 'src/.dirbuild' that will re-create the required directory
structure and then be removed upon first make. This is to work around the limitations
of Git not tracking empty directories.

Support for this code is provided both via GitHub and the project website.
