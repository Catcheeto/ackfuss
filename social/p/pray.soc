CharAuto   Talk about narcissism ...~
CharFound  You crawl in the dust before $M.~
CharNoArg  You feel righteous, and maybe a little foolish.~
OtherAuto  $n mumbles a prayer to $mself.~
OtherFound $n falls down and grovels in the dirt before $N.~
OtherNoArg $n begs and grovels to the powers that be.~
VictFound  $n kisses the dirt at your feet.~
